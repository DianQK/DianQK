### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

During my free time, I engage in various activities:

- Addressing LLVM issues.
- Resolving Rust issues labeled as A-LLVM.
- Developing the Ruslin note-taking application.
- Expanding my knowledge of programming languages.
- Learning Neovim.
- Improving my English language skills.
- Playing Splatoon 3.

In my free time, I have commuting hours on weekdays, specifically from 8 AM to 9 AM and from 6:30 PM to 8 PM. I may also engage in activities from around 8 PM to 10 PM. On rest days, I should have the entire day free.

You can stay informed about my activities through [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=7c99b281e16056c8c993fc03a3ec7120599d239def52b1fdc8e586c27f1dc789%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia%2FShanghai), where I keep concise records of my tasks and events.
